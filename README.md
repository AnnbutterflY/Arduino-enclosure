# 前言 Forward
本次课题是为Arduino设计外壳，制作要求为

This project involves designing a enclosure for Arduino, with the following requirements

**1、** 结合 3D 打印与激光切割技术

Combine 3D printing and laser cutting technologies

**2、** 禁止使用胶水，仅可使用螺丝或机械连接

The use of glue is prohibited; only screws or mechanical connections are allowed

**3、** 设计一个具有未来合理性的产品（Speculative Product），并为其制作外壳，推想该设计从构建一个可发生的未来开始。通过“未来世界”的设定，设计可以摆脱当下限制，探索替代思维

Design a speculative product with future plausibility and create a shell for it, imagining from the construction of a possible future. Through the setting of a "future world," design can break free from present constraints and explore alternative thinking

## 由此，我的世界构想为 Therefore, my world concept is:

**未来法律设定：** 所有家庭和公共空间不得使用一次性电子产品，所有硬件设备必须采用“可生长、可修复”的模块化设计，通过环境引导其功能发展。人们像培育植物一样“养”设备，而非简单购买固定功能的产品.

**社会形态与关键事件：** 地球经历工业体系崩塌和环境严重破坏的关键事件后，人类社会转向技术与生态共生的模式。社区不再依赖大型工厂生产日常设备，而是以家庭和社区为单位，通过“培养”技术植物满足生产和生活需求。社会形态呈现去中心化、生态化与模块化协作特征。

**整体环境与视觉风格：** 城市与废墟交融，建筑表面、屋顶、墙面遍布发光的电子藤蔓和生长的设备花朵。视觉风格融合科技与有机生物形态，光线柔和、呼吸式光源贯穿环境，半废墟、半生机的未来景观。

**生活方式、日常行为与核心需求:** 人们的生活不再围绕购买设备，而是通过培育和引导设备成长来满足生活需求。日常行为像照顾植物一样：调节光照、湿度和养分，引导设备长出不同功能模块。核心需求从“拥有设备”转向“培养、共生与管理设备成长”。

**Future Legal Framework:** All households and public spaces are prohibited from using disposable electronic products. All hardware devices must adopt a modular design that is “growable and repairable,” allowing their functions to develop through environmental guidance. People “nurture” devices like plants, rather than simply purchasing products with fixed functions.

**Societal Structure and Key Events:** Following critical events such as the collapse of industrial systems and severe environmental degradation, human society has shifted toward a model of technological-ecological symbiosis. Communities no longer rely on large factories to produce daily devices; instead, households and local communities “cultivate” technological plants to meet production and living needs. Society is characterized by decentralization, ecological integration, and modular collaboration.

**Overall Environment and Visual Style:** Cities blend with ruins, with building surfaces, rooftops, and walls covered in glowing electronic vines and blossoming devices. The visual style merges technology with organic, biological forms, featuring soft lighting and breathing light sources throughout the environment, creating a semi-ruined yet semi-vibrant futuristic landscape.

**Lifestyle, Daily Practices, and Core Needs:** Life is no longer centered on purchasing devices; instead, people nurture and guide devices’ growth to meet their needs. Daily actions resemble caring for plants: adjusting light, humidity, and nutrients to guide devices in growing different functional modules. Core needs have shifted from “owning devices” to “cultivating, coexisting with, and managing the growth of devices.”

# 反思 Reflection
在本次课题的制作过程中，我出现过问题。我制作的模型偏离了“HTAM”，我将它肆意捏造形状，而非着重于物体被激光切割和3d打印的制造方式，这导致我的外壳更像一个难以被制作的个人艺术装置，而不是未来的世界中的arduino外壳制作。老师及时地提醒了我。在审课题时，我应该认真关注题目后的学会制造物品的目的。

During the production process of this project, I encountered the problem.My model deviated from the core idea of “HTAM.” I arbitrarily shaped it based on imagination, rather than focusing on how the object should be manufactured through laser cutting and 3D printing. As a result, my shell became more like a personal art installation that would be difficult to produce, rather than a realistic Arduino case in a future world. Fortunately, the teacher reminded me in time. When reviewing the topic, I should carefully pay attention to the purpose behind it—to learn how to manufacture objects.
